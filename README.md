This repository contains code for classification of customers as good/bad depending on their details. German credit data obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
was used for training the Cobra Classifier.
</br></br>
MA691_data_exploration: This file contains all the code and their respective results and inferences drawn from the dataset. Based on these inferences the attributes were either further processed or dropped to improve model performance.
</br>
MA691_Model: This file includes the complete model which was trained on the dataset as obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository. It contains code from preprocessing to training and testing of the model.
</br>
MA691_Deployed_Model: The code in the complete model was further edited to suit the deployment procedure.
</br>
MA691_Report: In our report for the whole project we describe the procedure comprehensively, mentioning the inferences and decisions at each stage.
